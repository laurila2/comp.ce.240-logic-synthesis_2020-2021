- Adder is harder to produce.
  Adder tree is unbalanced.

- Diffrences between VHDL's architecture levels structural and RTL are:
  In RTL only basic components (gates, flip flops, etc.) are made.
  In structural architecture is only for hierarcial components.

- Hierarchical design is implemented in VHDL with structural architecture.
